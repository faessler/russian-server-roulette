# Russian Server Roulette
<div class="admonition warning">
BEWARE: It can delete everything on your Server/Computer! Playing on own risk!
</div>

## How does the Game work
It works like the classic Russian Roulette but instead of pointing with a gun to your brain, you'll point with that gun to your server/computer.

One in Six times it will execute the command ```rm -rf /``` and delete everything on your server/computer. When this happens you've lost and your server/computer is dead.

## How to Play
<div class="admonition warning">
Do not copy paste this command into your command prompt if you don't understand what it does. Executing this bash script is on your own risk!
</div>

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faessler/russian-server-roulette/master/revolver.bash | bash
```
